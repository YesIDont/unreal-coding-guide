The TEXT macro is primarily used for two purposes:
- Unicode Compatibility: It ensures that the literal is treated as a Unicode string (UTF-16/32 on Windows, UTF-8 on other platforms) by prefixing it with L on platforms where TCHAR is defined as wchar_t (like Windows). This is important for internationalization and localization.
- Consistency with Unreal's TCHAR Type: Unreal Engine uses TCHAR as its character type, and FString is designed to work with TCHAR. Using TEXT ensures that string literals are of the correct type.

## Q&A

### Q: Is it save to omit FString constructor in favor of schorter TEXT("string") syntax? As if:
```cpp
long syntax:
FString LongSyntax = FString(TEXT("string"));

short syntax:
FString ShortSyntax = TEXT("string");
```

### A:
Yes, in Unreal Engine C++, it is generally safe and common to use the shorter TEXT("string") syntax when assigning a string to an FString. The FString constructor is able to implicitly handle the conversion from a TCHAR array (which is what TEXT macro produces) to an FString.

Here’s a bit more detail:
- FString LongSyntax = FString(TEXT("string")); explicitly calls the FString constructor with a const TCHAR* argument (produced by the TEXT macro).
- FString ShortSyntax = TEXT("string"); relies on the FString's implicit constructor that accepts a const TCHAR*. This is a shorthand and is typically preferred for its brevity and clarity.

Both lines effectively do the same thing, but the shorter syntax is cleaner and more commonly used in Unreal Engine code. It’s also worth noting that Unreal Engine’s FString is designed to work seamlessly with the TEXT macro, making this kind of assignment very natural in UE4 and UE5 codebases.

In summary, you can safely use FString ShortSyntax = TEXT("string"); for a more concise and readable code style in Unreal Engine C++.

In Unreal Engine, whether you can omit the TEXT macro depends on the context and how the string will be used. The TEXT macro is primarily used for two purposes:
- Unicode Compatibility: It ensures that the literal is treated as a Unicode string (UTF-16/32 on Windows, UTF-8 on other platforms) by prefixing it with L on platforms where TCHAR is defined as wchar_t (like Windows). This is important for internationalization and localization-

### Q: Can I omit TEXT macro when I create strings that are not presented to the user?
### A: In Unreal Engine, whether you can omit the TEXT macro depends on the context and how the string will be used.

#### When You Can Omit TEXT:
- Non-Localized Strings: For strings that are not user-facing and don't require localization (like internal identifiers, tags, or debugging strings), you can often omit TEXT.
- ASCII Strings: If you're certain the string will only contain ASCII characters and the code will only run on platforms where TCHAR is char, you could technically omit TEXT. However, this might reduce portability and clarity.

#### Best Practice:
- Use TEXT for Consistency: It's generally recommended to use TEXT for all string literals in Unreal Engine code for consistency, even if the string is not presented to the user. This ensures that your strings are always in the correct format for FString and TCHAR arrays, regardless of the platform and build configuration.
- Localization and Future-Proofing: Even if a string is not user-facing now, using TEXT means you won't have to refactor if you later decide to localize the string or use it in a user-facing context.

#### Example:

```cpp
// Using TEXT macro for consistency and future-proofing
FString MyString = TEXT("InternalString");

// Without TEXT macro (acceptable for non-localized, internal strings)
FString MySimpleASCIIString = "SimpleASCII";
```

In summary, while you can sometimes omit TEXT for non-user-facing strings, it's generally good practice to use it for all string literals to maintain consistency and ensure compatibility across different platforms and build configurations.

### Cases where TEXT macro is not needed:
- standard HTTP headers (ASCII characters only)
